## COWORKER & PERMISSIONS SYSTEM GUIDE

### Understanding Coworkers

**What is a Coworker?**  
A coworker is a special type of admin account that has limited access to the admin panel. Unlike full administrators who can access everything, coworkers can only access specific sections based on permissions assigned by administrators.

**Why Use Coworkers?**  
Coworkers allow you to delegate specific responsibilities to team members without giving them full administrative access. This improves security and ensures team members only see what they need for their job.

---

### Creating a Coworker Account

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to Admin Users**
   - Go to **Users** → **Admin Users**
   - You will see two tabs: "Admins" and "Coworkers"

2. **Create New Coworker**
   - Click the **"Add Coworker"** button
   - Fill in the coworker information:
     - **Name:** Full name of the person
     - **Email:** Their email address (used for login)
     - **Phone:** Contact number (optional)
     - **Password:** Create a secure password
     - **Confirm Password:** Re-enter the password
   - Click **"Create Coworker"**

3. **Assign Permissions**
   - After creating the coworker, find them in the coworker list
   - Click the three dots (⋯) menu next to their name
   - Select **"Edit Permissions"**
   - A modal will open showing all available pages

4. **Select Permissions**
   - Check the boxes next to pages the coworker should access
   - Available pages include:
     - **Dashboard:** Overview statistics
     - **Users:** Manage regular users
     - **Clients:** View and manage clients
     - **Products:** Manage products
     - **Categories:** Manage product categories
     - **Orders:** View and manage orders
     - **Commission:** View commission settings
     - **Withdraw Request:** Process withdrawal requests
     - **Discount Code:** Manage discount codes
